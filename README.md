# 2D Game in Unity

This project is a 2D game built with Unity and C#.  
It includes basic gameplay mechanics, a working inventory system, and enemy AI.  

The main goal of this project was to practice and experiment with:
- Vector math
- Character movement
- Enemy intelligence and behavior
- A W S D for move, C for attack, 1-9 inventory, SPACE skip dialog

The storyline and the addition of new items were postponed, so the game is more of a programming project than a fully developed game.
